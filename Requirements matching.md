### Requirements matching 

To carry out the validation of the correspondence, initially, we thoroughly evaluate the requirements, considering the following aspects:


**Validity:** encompasses the acceptance of all perspectives. By listening to different points of view, it is possible to identify improvements that could have been overlooked, as well as the elimination of elements that do not fulfill their function.


**Consistency:** We ensure that requirements are consistent with each other, avoiding contradictions that may arise between different points of requirements.


**Completeness:** We ensure that all necessary requirements are present, allowing a thorough review before moving on to the next development phase.


**Realism:** We verify the feasibility of implementing the requirements in real life, considering the technology and tools available.


**Verifiability:** we ensure that each requirement is verifiable, that is, that it can be checked and fulfilled.


As a validation technique, we use the use case walkthrough. Its main objective is to discover possible conflicts in the product under review, which facilitates the proposal of alternatives and increases the participants' knowledge of the product.


During these sessions, a detailed review is carried out, allowing each participant to contribute his or her perspective. Applied to the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), this technique facilitates the understanding of the meaning of each requirement, allowing participants to express their agreement or disagreement with them. In addition, by applying this technique to the use cases, the sequence of steps is validated in a natural way by walking through them with the participation of all involved.
