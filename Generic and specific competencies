# Specific competencies

***Specific competencies used in the project, throughout the entire semester.***

In the development of the project we used methodologies, methods and tools as we acquired knowledge about them in classes.
At the beginning, we used knowledge about analysis and definition of requirements; then we prioritize them with the voting methods and Moscow. When learning about lifecycle models, we chose the SCRUM framework as it seemed simple and suitable; Based on this election, we assigned roles to our team members and frequently held meetings to review progress. As for supply chain management tools, we use Github.
In the next installment, we refine the requirements. To do this, we use artifacts such as user stories and use cases. As for the design phase, we did architectural designs and interface sketches in a tool called Miro. These designs were verified and validated.
In the final delivery, we apply skills in carrying out informal tests, for which we use the Maze tool. Based on the results, we reviewed the designs and perfected them, obtaining the final designs. It was here that we applied what we learned in class to make the collaboration metric, using a method of measuring tasks that uses the number of hours to carry them out as a reference, and taking into account the comments of the team members to reach agreements. .
Throughout the project, we increasingly focused on the analysis of the competencies of each team member, to assign tasks according to their best abilities. Regarding task reassignment, sometimes we assign multiple people to some tasks that were initially assigned to only one.
Throughout the project, we learned about the importance of documenting the process. Using logs, the product backlog and process planning and monitoring techniques was essential to improve our own process.
