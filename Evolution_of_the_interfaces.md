## Evolution of the interfaces
The wireframe changes were very noticeable, because, although in base they remain with almost the same functions, when we realized that the Miro program did not have the option of testing with testers, simulations or animations, then we had to transfer our work to the figma program but we could not transport our progress already made, so the development team opted to manually transfer the screens, although modifications were made in the process.
We tried to make a more visually striking design, adding colors, the project's logo and buttons that allow you to slide between screens; Another point that we polished was the compact of elements, trying to make the functions look clearer and there is a better visual organization. And as this task progressed, elements were added or eliminated.


### Deleted Items
Adaptability with IOS: This requirement was eliminated, because we consider it to be unnecessary at the time of development, since we could consider other more important requirements such as a navigation bar or supervision, that is, the way that our application is used for the established purposes and there is no controversy between the same users. Considering the above, we allocated resources to functions that had to be polished (product publication, user registration, active interaction, etc.), seeing it in this way, in this testing phase we do not consider it urgent to make an application compatible with more devices, if not functional.


Notifications: In the same way as the previous point, in the testing phase we analyzed and came to the conclusion that notifications are not a necessary function, or at least not as necessary as the other requirements that can be seen in wireframes. Our point of focus was that the application should be intuitive for the user and of a pleasant design, functional and that it would meet the basic objectives set, that it should be an application intended for the publication of products and a means of communication of users within the application


### Added Items
Prohibit the publication of products: In the interfaces, we added the main function of the application which had not been shown in the second installment, which was to upload a product, the way to publish an article is to enter from the user's profile, then press the option to "publish" and choose a photo from the gallery,  implementing user data, description of the item and the option to report in case of not complying with the rules established by the application, as a sanction the user can be temporarily or even permanently blocked


Navbar: a navigation bar was added to the home screen in the application, allowing better navigation between the different functions, with intuitive icons for test users, with the aim of making it easy to identify the different tools that our application has


Search bar: Screens have been added with the specific function of showing how a search bar would work for product placement, making it easier for shopper users to find an item of interest optimally


Animations: When entering the app, we add an opening animation that shows the app's logo with its tagline. Transition animations between screens were also implemented to show a presentation closer to the desired product
