The creation of U-Sales allows the sale and purchase of products designed specifically for university students. This project focuses on addressing the needs of university students, offering a digital platform that simplifies the process of buying and selling products, encourages social interaction and provides specific solutions to improve the student experience.

### Reasons for the project
Student Demand: University students often face logistical and economic challenges when searching for and selling products, allowing entrepreneurs to solve their monetary needs, and buyers solving their need for products.


Shortage of Specific Platforms: Although general e-commerce platforms exist, the lack of specific options for university students leaves a gap in the market that this project aims to fill.

### Innovative features
#### 1. Social Exchange Functions:
Integration of social media features that allow students to connect, follow and recommend products to each other, fostering an online student community.
#### 2. Rating and Reviews System:
Implementation of a rating and review system for products and sellers, guaranteeing transparency and trust in transactions.
#### 3. Focus on Student Products:
The application focuses on products relevant to university students, allowing the sales opportunity exclusively to higher-level students, with the aim of a venture that supports their academic development, and polishes business qualities.
