# Users

## User types

**Primary users:** Our primary users will be the sellers. They will be more active than other users, since they will frequently be publishing their sales, and establishing communication with their customers. Most of the content present in the application will be created by them. The sellers will be users who have been verified as students of the Autonomous University of Yucatán.

**Secondary users:** The secondary users will be the buyers. They are probably sporadic users of the app, who will use it only when they need to buy products on their campuses. They will not necessarily be students of the Autonomous University of Yucatán, although we hope that the majority will be.
