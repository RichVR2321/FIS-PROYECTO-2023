# Process description

The framework used is Scrum.

To carry out this work, there were significant changes in the way of working on the project, on this occasion more sprints were implemented, both in person and online, with the purpose of being able to provide feedback on the parts assigned to each of them; As already mentioned, the activities were assigned individually and a certain deadline was given by which all team members would have to have their part ready, so that later in the sprints, whether virtual or in-person, they would be given a feedback between all team members. This has brought positive results to the project, since by giving each other feedback, it helps us improve certain corrections that we have to make with our assigned parts.

The third delivery coincides with the third sprint, which began on November 19, and ends on December 10, 2023.
During the third sprint, 10 scrum days were held, in which the activities were done, doubts were resolved and decisions were made; as recorded in the meeting log.

On November 21, 2023, the decision was made to work on another repository different from the original, since for personal reasons the team leader could not continue managing the original repository. The migration of the old files was carried out by those assigned to the organization and documentation of the repository.

On November 30, Juan Che was entrusted with doing the DoD, added that same day to the rubric.

Both on November 19 and 26, when tasks were distributed, dates were established for the review of completed tasks. As can be seen in the meeting log, these detailed reviews were carried out on the following days:

- November 23, 2023
- December 9, 2023
  
On those dates, some tasks that had already been assigned previously were reassigned, but that due to time issues were not done or completed. The tasks that each team member ultimately completed are reflected in the individual contribution metric.
