## PART 1 NEWS

### In cabin

**Maria:** Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to the special edition of the "UADY NEWS" program. I am María Fernanda…

**Irad:** And I am Irad.

**Maria:** And today we will present you special information about the U-sales application.

**Irad:** It is an application recently developed by “Team 8”, Software Engineering students.

**María:** To learn more about U-Sales, we are going to make a link with our reporter Raymundo, who is in the facilities of the engineering faculty.

**Irad:** Are we in contact, Raymundo?

**Raymundo:** Yes, greetings María, Irad, and our beloved audience. I am with the students of the Faculty of Mathematics. To learn about U-sales I am going to ask some questions to two members of team 8, U-sales developers, who are here with me. Good morning Brian and Ricardo.

**Brian and Ricardo:** Good morning.

### They talk about the product

**Raymundo:** I would like you to tell the audience about U-sales. What is U-sales?

**Ricardo:** U-sales is an application compatible with the Android operating system, designed to be used in the university environment. It is a platform that makes it easy to buy and sell items. The objective of the application is that students of the Autonomous University of Yucatán can easily and comfortably sell all types of items in their faculties.

**Raymundo:** He tells me that the application is designed to be used at a university. Why is a sales application for college students necessary?

**Brian:** We have noticed that many classmates sell products in their classrooms. They sell different types of things: Food, clothes, school supplies, etc. Likewise, many other colleagues are looking to buy items.

**Ricardo:** Although there are already other platforms for sales, they do not offer the functions that U-sales offers. At U-sales all sellers are students of the Autonomous University of Yucatán, we have filters so that this is always the case. The publications of the products that users will see in their application will be from their classmates who study at the same faculty, and who are therefore selling near them.

**Raymundo:** And users who are not sellers have to be UADY students?

**Brian:** Not necessarily, the clientele can be of all types, although in practice we believe that they will mainly be students.

### Now they talk about the functions. (Functional requirements).

**Raymundo:** It is clear to me what U-sales is and what audience it is aimed at. I would like you to tell us about the main functions that the application has.

**Ricardo:** It has very useful functions. In order to use U-sales, the user must register with an email. If the user wants to sell products on U-sales, he must carry out a simple verification process. Each user may make public information about himself that he considers useful.

**Brian:** Once the user is registered, he can see sales publications that match his preferences. If he is verified as a seller, he can also make posts.
To search for publications you can use the application's search engine.

**Ricardo:** All users can rate posts and comment on them. They will also be able to rate other users. They can also contact sellers privately with the instant messaging function.

**Brian:** If a user finds another user uncomfortable, they can block them. This way they will no longer be able to send messages to each other.

### Non-functional requirements

**Raymundo:** Is the application secure?

**Ricardo:** That's right, the protection of our users' data is our priority.

**Brian:** Regarding the content of the publications, a team of moderators will respond to any reports that may arise about the publications or other users. In this way we ensure that the publications are appropriate and the users are serious and respectful.


### Value proposal

**Raymundo:** The functions of U-sales are clear to me. Why should a UADY student download U-sales?

**Ricardo:** It is a secure, easy-to-use application, focused on sales within the university, designed for students and made by students.

**Raymundo:** I appreciate your answers, Ricardo, Brian, thank you very much. We return to the studio.

**María:** Thank you Raymundo. We also thank engineers Ricardo Vargas and Brian Manzanilla for their clear explanation.

**Irad:** This is U-sales, gentlemen. The new application that is revolutionizing the way sales are made at UADY.

**María:** Next, we go on to show a video sent to our production.

**Irad:** Run video…

## PART 2 FEEDBACK

### We talk about the birth of the idea and our framework

**Narrator 1 (Juan):** We have worked approximately 3 months on this project. We chose to use the SCRUM framework as it seemed appropriate given the time we had to complete development and the frequency of deliverables. We have carried out 3 sprints, each lasting one month.

**Narrator 2 (Brian):** In the early days of the project, we identified some people's needs that could perhaps be solved with a software program. We were struck by the problem that exists in our university's sales WhatsApp groups, where finding the product you want is very difficult. Sales are lost among hundreds of messages. That is when we conceived the creation of U-sales.

**Narrator 3 (Irad):** After giving identity to our platform by giving it a name, we chose SCRUM as the framework. We started doing our Daily Scrum.

### The installments

**Narrator 4 (Raymundo):** In the first installment, among other things, we made a list of requirements.

**Narrator 5 (Maria):** In the second, we use some artifacts, such as use cases, use case diagrams and user stories, to improve our requirements, discarding some and improving others. We also sketched out our interfaces.

**Narrator 1 (Juan):** In the third installment we did the final design of our interfaces. We have done simulations and use tests. We have perfected our artifacts, which have helped us improve the final product.

**Narrator 2 (Brian):** In each delivery we have documented our progress through documents and a video. We constantly document the changes we make to the product. We use methods to improve our tasks and processes.

### Challenges and learnings

**Narrator 3 (Irad):** During the completion of this project we have had many challenges. We learned to work with a methodology. It has been important to know how to play a role in the team. We have learned to use useful tools in software development. We are very happy to conclude this project.
