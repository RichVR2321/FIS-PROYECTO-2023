# Product evolution

In this text we intend to present the most significant changes in terms of the planning and design of our product.
To compare the changes in the product we can base ourselves on 3 sections, established in the rubrics:

   •	Product

   •	Requirements

   •	Design

However, in this same installment we have already made comparisons of 2 sections; Therefore, we only add the links to the documents of these comparisons:

   • [Requirements](https://github.com/RichVR2321/FIS-PROYECTO-2023/blob/Tercera_Entrega/Requirement%20evolution.md)

   • Design (Hyperlink)

In this document we present the comparison of the missing section, the Product section.


## Documents from the Product section

We present the list of documents from the Product section that we have prepared in the first, second and third delivery:

| **First delivery** | **Second installment** | **Third installment** |

We can notice that in the second installment we only made one document. The title of the document is wrong (It should be called Product Evolution), and its content deals little with the product, or its evolution. In the second installment there were changes almost exclusively in terms of requirements and design.

# Deliveries summary

## First delivery
### Product description:
U-Sale is a mobile application designed to facilitate buyer-seller interaction, which occurs in university environments. It is based on a system that shows publications of the products that users offer, in real time. The application has the option to rate other users, or publications. It has an instant messaging service, as well as information about users.
### Users/clients:
There will be two types of users: buyers and sellers.

• Selling users: only students enrolled in registered Universities, who will be able to promote their products.

• Buyer users: are all those people who wish to purchase the products offered within the application. To be this type of user there will not be any type of filter.
The potential users are mainly young university students with an age range of 18 to 25 years.

### Value proposition: Unlike other platforms used for sales, on U-Sale it is much easier to find or promote a product, since it prioritizes the display of publications for each user depending on their location or preferences. Its search engine helps you find publications. The rating system helps users decide which products to buy.

## Second delivery
### Evolution of the project:
Selling users can only be those who are verified as students of the Autonomous University of Yucatán.

## Third installment
