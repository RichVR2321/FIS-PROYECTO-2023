## CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF THE COURSE 

#### *A critique (arguments) is made to the activities that can be improved, changed or eliminated.*

**Time of evaluation**

We suggest that the dates on which the activities are evaluated should be different, since if the first two deliveries are evaluated at the same time, we consider that the opportunity for improvement is lost, because if you do not know what went wrong in the first delivery, it will be difficult to improve the second delivery. After each delivery, the time we wait to receive our rating, we would like it not to be prolonged.

**Weekly update**

It would have been a great help if weekly updates had been implemented from the beginning of the project, since it is at that phase when most doubts emerge, because we are just starting to adapt to the project, to the subject, to the university and all that it entails. We believe that having the teacher even 10 minutes a week, from the beginning of the project, avoids errors in the first deliveries, because receiving orientation from the beginning helps to perfect the work.

**Group union**

We consider that taking the classes in both groups together or separately, is something that does not influence the delivery of the topics seen in the plenary sessions; and for the activities that we propose later in this text, the fact that we are separated by the groups already established would speed up the time and the implementation of these activities.

#### *Alternative (specific) activities are proposed that could enhance the promotion of the course competencies.*

**Practical examples that have to do with the topics seen**

We would like a central part of the sessions to be more analysis of examples when explaining a methodology, method or artifact. Not just looking at a single slide, but really analyzing in depth how this example is part of a process, or if it is an artifact, why its content is correct, etc. 

**Classroom feedback activities on what was studied in the session**

We propose that in the sessions we work with examples in which the knowledge we study in each class is reflected. At the beginning of the course we analyze a project, the voting system, and think about requirements and proposals for its development. We consider this type of analysis and exemplification to be very useful, as it allows us to consolidate our knowledge, improve our understanding of it and learn to apply it.

**Activities in the classroom for reflection and debate**

We consider that reflection activities are essential to review theory. The fact of writing in class, with limited time and with our own words, an argumentative text in which we explain our position or interpretation of a concept, model, practice, etc. It helps us to give more importance to the plenary sessions, and to study the materials and sources provided by the teachers on our own; Or that we investigate other sources.

For example, once in a practical session, as an activity we wrote a text about whether the waterfall model is good or bad. Those are the types of activities that we would like to see repeated more. Also, after writing the texts, we would like there to be a debate among group members about what was expressed in them.

In fact, we would like a type of activity implemented with some frequency to be doing quick discussions, probably between teams. We could take a position on some software development practice, and defend it. There could also be some type of debate when carrying out activities such as determining the requirements of a hypothetical case, or which life cycle model is appropriate for a particular case.
