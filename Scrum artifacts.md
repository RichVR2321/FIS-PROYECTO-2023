### DoD (Definition of done)

***DoD of the interface design increase, already having a sketch.***

- There is a detailed design of smartphone screens in figma, in which the use of design guides is reflected.

- The screens are linked to each other in such a way that simulations of use can be made with them.

- An informal test has been carried out with the maze tool, resulting in passing percentages (60% in terms of positive characteristics and evaluations and 40% in terms of negative ones). The speed to carry out activities is less than one minute.

- Informal tests have been done with people, of three tasks included in the use cases. The method for testing is to do a survey. When converting the parameters to percentages they average more than 60%.

- The team has carried out the verification and validation of the wireframes. Verification is documented.

- The changes made with respect to the sketches of the previous delivery, and those made after carrying out the tests, have been documented.
